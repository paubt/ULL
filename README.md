## 1. path search aglorithm in python

* folder: aiBusq
* tasks: 
    1.  ceate grid structure 
    2.  implement different algorithms (in our case (mu,lambda) and (mu+lambda)
    3.  evaluate the two different algortihms in different scenarions and compare them
    4.  write [infrome](./aiBusq/informev2.pdf)
* language: python

* __note:__ main source was [Sean Luke, Essentials of Metaheuristics](https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/book/metaheuristics/Essentials.pdf)


## 2. path search aglorithm in c++

* folder: aiBusqCpp
* tasks: same as in task 1. but in c++ (out of pure interest :))
* language: c++

* __note:__ main source was [Sean Luke, Essentials of Metaheuristics](https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/book/metaheuristics/Essentials.pdf)
